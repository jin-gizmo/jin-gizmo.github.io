A number of tools have been developed at [Origin
Energy](https://www.originenergy.com.au) as part of the *Jindabyne* initiative.
While not part of our core IP, they have proved valuable internally, and are
being shared in the hope they're useful to others.

Kudos to Origin for fostering a culture that empowers its people to build
complex technology solutions in-house.
